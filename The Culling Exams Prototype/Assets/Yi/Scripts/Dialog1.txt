LabMonitor: Welcome to your Culling Exam. I will be monitoring your progress. Would you like for me to go over the rules for you?
Eliza: Yes please
LabMonitor: The objective for this exam is to pass through a series of puzzles in or under the desired amount of moves and make it to the next stage until you reach the end. Use “WASD” to move up, left, down, or right respectively. Use the mouse to look around and use the “Left click button” to select the movable object and move it to its desired position. You can only move objects one space forward, left or right. You may not move with the object. Would you like for me to repeat the rules for you?
Eliza: No thank you. I think I got it.
LabMonitor: Very Well. Then good luck and I look forward to you becoming a productive member of society.
